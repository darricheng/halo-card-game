# Halo: The Card Game
Welcome to the Tutorial for Halo: The Card Game!

This tutorial will go through the basics of the game.

![game-screen](./assets/tut/game-screen-details.jpeg)

2: Prophet of Regret and his health

3: Cortana and her health (You!)

4: The available resources for each player to play cards

5: The main game button

6: Attack token indicators (Presence of battle rifle means an attack is available)

7: Cards in each player's hand

9: The battle zone

10: The message box, where all game messages are displayed

11: The tutorial button to access this tutorial

12: Phantom dropship (aesthetics)

13: Pelican dropship (aesthetics)

## Card Details
What a card looks like:

![card-details](./assets/tut/card-details.jpeg)

1: The card action button

2: The cost of each card, i.e. how much resources is needed to summon this unit

3: The unit's attack

4: The unit's health

5: Card art

## Goal
Kill the Prophet of Regret, i.e. reduce his health to 0, while staying alive!

You can do so by summoning units to the battlefield and attacking him.

## Game Mechanics
This game is heavily inspired by Legends of Runeterra, so if you're familiar with LoR, you'll be familiar with the mechanics of this game too.

Each round, the player with the attack token (indicated by a floating battle rifle) gets to act first.
There are a few things they can do:
- Summon a unit
- Declare an attack
- Pass

As for the player without the attack token, they can only summon a unit or pass (unless the opposing player declares an attack).

The round ends when both players pass. 

At the start of the new round, the previously defending player gain the attack token and the initiative to act first for the round.

## Card Action Button
Most actions involving the card are executed with this button.

Clicking the button on a card in the following states results in the respective outcome:
- Card in hand: Summons the unit
- Card in backline: Shifts unit to the Battle Zone
- Card in battle zone: Shifts unit back to backline
- When opponent is declaring an attack: Selects unit to place in a defence slot

## Main Game Button
Hitting this button at the appropriate time will progress the game state accordingly.

The text on the button will be updated to reflect how the game will be progressed:
- Pass: Pass your turn
- Attack: Declare an attack with your units in the battle zone
- Declare blockers: Block the opponent's attack with the declared units
- Opponent's turn: As described
- End round: End the round as the opponent also passed their turn

## Battle Zone Combat
To kill the opponent, you'll have to attack them with your units.

This section will describe how to do battle with your units.

## Declare Attack
When it's your turn and you have the attack token, you can declare an attack.

This is done by first clicking on the card action button on units in your backline that you want to attack with.
Doing so will shift those units into the battle zone.

You'll see the main game button text update to "attack".

If you click the main game button now, you'll declare an attack with the units in the battle zone.

Example:

![declare-attack](./assets/tut/declare-attack.png)

In the above example, the player is declaring an attack with only the two marines in the battle zone.

## Declare Defenders
When your opponent declares an attack, you have an opportunity to place your defenders in the battle zone to block the incoming attack.

Blocking with your units results in no damage taken to your health. 
Instead, both units will do battle, reducing the opposing unit's health by their attack value.

When the opponent declares an attack, the board will update to show the following:

![defence-prep](./assets/tut/defence-prep.png)

The blue boxes indicate where defenders can be placed to block the opponent's units.

At this point, if you click the game button to declare blockers, all the opponent's units will deal damage to your health because none of them are blocked by your units.

To block, you must first click the action button of a unit you want to block with. The following will then appear:

![place-defencer](./assets/tut/place-defender.png)

As stated by the text, you can then click on a defence slot to place the selected unit into that slot, blocking the opposite attacker from dealing damage to your health.

If you change your mind about your blockers, simply click on the card action button again to remove the unit from the defence slot and move it back to the backline.

## End
That is all for this tutorial. Now go out there and kick some Covenant butt!
