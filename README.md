# HALO: The Card Game

## Self-introduction

My name is Darric; I have great interest in developing software products that will benefit the lives of people.

This is my first noteworthy project in my journey of learning software, completed in conjunction with the Software Engineering Immersive course by General Assembly.

## Game Introduction

I'm inspired to create a card game as I'm an avid player of [Legends of Runterra](https://playruneterra.com/) (LoR).

_Side note: I highly recommend the game to anyone who likes strategic games, especially of the TCG variant. #not-sponsored_

I like LoR's turn based system a lot compared with the systems of other card games, especially the high level of interactivity between the two players, so my goal was to try emulating the game as a study into how such a system could be implemented with software.

This game is the result of my attempt. I use [Halo](https://www.halowaypoint.com/) as the setting for my game â€” it's one of my all time favourite childhood games.

I call it **HALO: The Card Game**.

## Game Description

You play as Cortana battling against the Prophet of Regret in a virtual battlefield. Your goal is to defeat Regret by overwhelming their forces with your army of UNSC units, so that you can eventually bring their health down to 0. Be careful though, you lose if your health goes down to 0 too!

What are you waiting for? Go out there and kick some Covenant butt!
